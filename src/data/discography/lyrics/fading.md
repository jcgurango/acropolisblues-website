Between these walls I am imprisoned,
In a box of my design,
I close my eyes and beg for vision,
But all I see is streaks of white,
I'm fading,
I, I'm fading,

And all my life I've felt the borders,
From all the lines that others leave,
I'd pace the halls and every corner,
Wondering if anybody feels like me,
I'm fading,
I, I'm fading,

Take my soul,
Take all that I know,
I have lost all control,
