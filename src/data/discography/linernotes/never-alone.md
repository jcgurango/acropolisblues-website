This song was actually a challenge from my then-girlfriend, (now either fiancee or wife, depending on when you’re reading this!) Faye. I had written maybe 4 songs already for The Marketplace, but she astutely observed that it’s all so heartbreak-y. The truth about love songs is they’re very easy to write. From almost any perspective, you have such a wealth of other songs to take ideas and copy from that if you can’t write a love song, you either have never loved or never written a song. So, as much as possible I try to not write the same love song as everybody’s ever written, to try and find unique perspectives to write about.

She wanted to me to write about a perspective that not many songs are really about — outside of the “party club banger” type of song. This is ultimately a song about friendship and camaraderie, and it’s one of my favorite songs I’ve written because that’s not the kind of love you hear about very often and it came out really cute.
