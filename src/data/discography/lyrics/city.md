[Verse]
A window stands between myself and Manila,
As her pale eyes shine in the moonlight,
My shaking hands wonder what it takes to be with her,
For just one night I wanna feel like
I am not a stranger.

[Chorus]
This city held my hand,
But I had better plans,
And I was out for more.
As every busy street,
Slowly sang me to sleep,
Oh I was all alone.

[Verse]
Staring at a glass that's filled to half with tequila,
I promised that I'd go easy this time,
Can't change the past but still the last feels no better,
To feelings I haven't set aside
I am not a stranger.
Cause I am not a stranger.

[Chorus]
This city held my hand,
But I had better plans,
And I was out for more.
As every busy street,
Slowly sang me to sleep,
Oh I was all alone.

[Bridge]
I'll spend the daylight in my bedroom,
Just to get my head right and I'll be out soon,
And as the sun falls down,
I'll feel it all around,
And I will not come out.

[Verse]
A distance stands between myself and Manila,
And my chocolate eyes never feel right,
Is it best if I removed myself from the picture?
No matter the light I never feel like
I am not the stranger.
