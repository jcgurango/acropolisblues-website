I remember how I wrote that opening riff – it was on the toilet! On my Telegram I use the “Saved Messages” feature extensively to quickly record voice messages of my musical ideas. For this riff, I sang it. It was actually originally going to be a vocal melody and I had some lyrics written up that went okay with it. One day, I was just messing around on my bass and had the idea to play this riff on it just to see how it would sound. I threw some heavy distortion on and boom – there’s an intro for you. Then the rest of the song just kind of came to me. Sometimes that’s how it goes, you really hit the ground running and can write basically the whole song in a day or two. That just leaves the instrumentation and production. The drums, guitars, and bass are all me but the lead guitar is actually played by Eric. He plays the leads in quite a few of the songs in The Marketplace.

Story-wise it’s about how often times it’s not clear-cut how or why relationships end. As much as we’d like to believe it’s always somebody’s fault, choosing to blame and hold aggression towards our partners or even ourselves just leads to a domino effect of ill will when, really, sometimes relationships just run their course. It’s hard to accept when it hits you, and often you do hold on for longer than you should, but that just takes a toll on you and your partner.
