[Verse: JC]
All I wanna do is go back to a time when it wasn't so hard to be happy,
No distance between my loves and me.
All I wanna do is be a child in my innocence, running 'round wild and free.
I may seem naive, but it's my only dream,
Once in a while, just to see.

[Chorus]
Cause this new house doesn't feel like home,
I'll reminisce about the nights spent in my bedroom alone,
Take me back to the pond where we'd be skipping stones,
Cause this new house doesn't feel like home.

[Verse: Ivee]
I saw an old friend in the back of a picture that I haven't seen since I was 10,
Thought maybe I'd call him again.
I said I'll meet you on the street, by the place we used to eat,
I hope you didn't forget.
I can't wait to see you this weekend.

[Chorus]
Cause this new house doesn't feel like home,
I'll reminisce about the nights spent in my bedroom alone,
Take me back to the pond where we'd be skipping stones,
Cause this new house doesn't feel like home.

[Bridge]
Well, hello old friend,
Hello old friend!
It's nice to see you again.
Do you remember when we used to talk all day and night?
I think about it all the time!

[Chorus]
Cause this new house doesn't feel like home,
I'll reminisce about the nights spent in my bedroom alone,
Take me back to the pond where we'd be skipping stones,
Cause this new house doesn't feel like home.
