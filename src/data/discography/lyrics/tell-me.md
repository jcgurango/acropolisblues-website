[Verse]
Excuse me miss,
But have you got a second?
Cause it occurs to me,
That the words you speak,
Put me at ease. 

And tell me this,
I’ve spend the whole night guessing,
If the company,
That you seem to keep,
Means that I, should leave,

[Pre Chorus]
And I’m a long way home,
At least I didn’t have to say goodbye,

[Chorus]
Tell me tell me how you feel,
And if these thoughts are all too real,
I’ll play the part to help you heal,
But keep your heart and hold the wheel,
And many many played the field,
They’ll give you lines and make their deals,
Don’t worry yet the night’s not over,
I just wish I was sober,

[Verse]
So tell me how,
I’m ready to get started,
And the third degree,
That you guarantee,
It flows perfectly,

We’re in this now,
One look and then you nodded,
Are we in too deep,
When you wouldn’t leave?
I think I, can believe,

[Pre Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You could take everything I have,
And I would watch it all,
I would watch it fall,
And if the gravity would lapse,
Then maybe I can finally relax,

[Chorus]
