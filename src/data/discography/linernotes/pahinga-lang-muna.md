Sometimes you love somebody, or intend to love somebody, but other things just get in the way. Whether it's your commitment to other parts of your life that prevent you from being able to spend a significant amount of time with them, or just you being afraid of being hurt. It's not necessarily a bad thing to be unable to love somebody at any given time, but you need to be aware and mature enough to have a conversation with them so they aren't simply waiting for an answer. If it's not meant to be now, it's not meant to be. Perhaps some day that'll change, but until then, pahinga lang muna.

This is one of the first songs I'm releasing that I wrote, produced, mixed, and mastered on my own, and I plan to continue doing so. Before this I had always sent out my music to somebody else. For a while, that was Gavin Maunsell over at [gpmsounds](http://www.gpmsounds.co.uk/), and Paulo Germano at [pgaudio](http://www.pgaudio.com.br/site/). Perhaps I believed that getting somebody more qualified than myself would lead to better music. It certainly led to better *sound*. Or maybe I just wasn't confident enough in my own ability. I also wrote this song in Tagalog, because I believe that the language is far more proficient at expressing this sort of emotion. Needless to say, this song means a lot to me and it serves as a symbol of how much I have grown as a person, and as an artist. I no longer feel the need to obsessively send my songs out to as many people as I can for feedback, or hide behind flashy marketing or gimmicks. Instead, this is just me as I am.
