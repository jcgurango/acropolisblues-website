[Verse]
With every story told, every page we turn together,
The ties between our souls, deepen with every passing letter,
So never shall we fold, we’ll see the ending of forever,

[Prechorus]
And through pain and heartache,
You can count on me,

[Chorus]
I can see the bright side,
Of any cloud that follows,
As long as you’re here in my life,
I’ll never find myself alone,

[Verse]
So when you’re in the cold, I’ll be the warmth that makes you better,
Cause every bond we hold, brings the best out of each other,

[Prechorus]
And through pain and heartache,
You can count on me,

[Chorus]
I can see the bright side,
Of any cloud that follows,
As long as you’re here in my life,
I’ll never find myself alone,

[Bridge]
Without you, I am suffering,
So come and get me, I’ll be by your side,

[Chorus]
I can see the bright side,
Of any cloud that follows,
As long as you’re here in my life,
I’ll never find myself alone,
