This was a super fun song to write! I got the itch to write a musical again, but I know from doing just that, that it's a lot of work. For one, the songs themselves are easily an entire album's worth; and that's just writing. After that you need to do blocking, choreography, props, so many things. However, it occurred to me that a lot of people are experiencing musicals for the first time through original broadway cast recordings. And it's not a new concept to make a few songs in the musical very pop-y and easy to digest, just so that it could be released on its own; that's what showtunes are and the first time I heard about Dear Evan Hansen was through its song "If I Could Tell Her."

So I had this idea to write a song for a musical that doesn't exist. Just a specific scene in an unspecified musical that feels like it has a larger story to it. I was inspired by the story "The Necklace" by Guy de Maupassant, so I thought I'd write a song for a section of that story. I thought the string sounds would fit better than my usual sound, so those are still synths but they're wearing the clothing of a classical era, much like the actors in Bridgerton. Once I had the song down, I called my good friend Mish who sang the other part *beautifully* and we had a song! I still do hope to one day write a full musical again. It was an experience like no other, being around so many talented individuals all working towards a common goal.
