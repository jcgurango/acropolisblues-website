This is a song that's been in the works since before I even met Peter. Well, that's inaccurate since I *met* Peter long, long before I *got to know* Peter. He's a musician like me, and he's releasing an EP soon (might be out by the time you read this!). We've gotten together a bunch to trade musical ideas and to basically show each other our unfinished/unreleased works, and on his EP he had this one track with Christian Ituriaga's guitars on it and when I heard it I was just like damn, can I get the stems off this and cut em up and see what I come up with? And that became this track. We're trying to figure stuff out in our lives, that's why I haven't come out with anything in a year (again lol, seems I have a habit of skipping a year) but this track hopefully is the first of many.
