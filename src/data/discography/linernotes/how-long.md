I don’t often like to write songs specifically about a person, or people in my life. Generally, if I write a song about somebody, I don’t target it at them specifically but more at a character of them that exists outside of reality. I just don’t like the idea of a song being their song, because I don’t write music for them, I write it for me. Additionally, it helps in keeping Acropolis Blues the artist from JC Gurango the person.

But this one was different. I wrote it specifically for my fiancee, and I meant every word to be in speaking about her. She continues to be the light of my life, and in a sense not all of my songs are about her, but they’re all for her. Particularly this song talks about our interesting meet-cute and how we kind of rushed into things — but it ended up being exactly the right decision.
