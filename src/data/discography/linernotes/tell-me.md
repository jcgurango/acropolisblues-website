This song recounts the story of a woman I met while out drinking with some friends. As I recall, it was in Taft which wasn’t (and isn’t) my usual spot. I had gone there to visit some friends from La Salle. She was from France, was a bit taller than me, and was plenty cute. We played darts and talked the night away until it was time for me to go. In the song, I go through the motions of trying to psyche myself up to talk to her, and recite the often ridiculous thoughts you have when meeting somebody new. Little did I know I’d never see her again after that night, but boy was it fun.
