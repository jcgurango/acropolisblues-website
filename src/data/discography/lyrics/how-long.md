[Verse]
How long does it take to fall in love?
Could you measure it in seconds, the time it takes our hearts to beckon,
I know your situation made it tough,
But in the night, oh how time flies,

Now we were only meant to have a little fun,
But one thing led to another, now I’m calling you my lover,
Oh lady now you’ve got my heart strings by the scruff,
But do we know, where this will go,

[Prechorus]
When you take me by the hand,
The feeling takes over me, over me,
So you take me by the hand,
Take me from reality, reality,

[Chorus]
Stay close to me I think I’ve found,
Someone who seems to see the world and how
it works through my same eyes,
And pulls the sheet off my disguise,

And if it needs to be this way for now,
My heart will bleed for you until it drowns,
And you show me how to smile,
I haven’t felt this for a while,

[Verse]
How long has it been since we first met,
It seems a lifetime since the first thing, and lifetime left of learning,
What it takes to keep you smiling and I’ll bet,
That through time, you’ll stay mine,

[Prechorus]
When you take me by the hand,
The feeling takes over me, over me,
So take me by the hand,
Take me from reality, reality,

[Chorus]
Stay close to me I think I’ve found,
Someone who seems to see the world and how
it works through my same eyes,
And pulls the sheet off my disguise,

And if it needs to be this way for now,
My heart will bleed for you until it drowns,
And you show me how to smile,
I haven’t felt this for a while.
