[Verse]
My love, ma belle, why wouldn't we go?
I've not a dress, a pair of shoes, or a bow.
I'll have no less,
You will only have the best,
And you and I can go,

My love, ma belle, what's wrong what's right?
A jewel on my neck, and I'd be ready for the night!
I'll have no less,
We'll borrow diamonds from our friends,
And you and I can dance,

[Chorus]
Will you dance the night away with me?
Take a step in forward to the beat,
With your hands in mine I know I'll be complete,
I'll give you everything, everything and me,

[Verse]
I know we've got very little to spare,
My dear, think not of what we have or how we fare,
I've always been taught,
Whether a little or a lot,
That I will cherish what I've got,

[Chorus]
Will you dance the night away with me? (I'll dance with you)
Take a step in forward to the beat, (I feel it too)
With your hands in mine I know I'll be complete, (I know I'll be complete)
I'll give you everything, everything, everything,

[Bridge]
I've always been taught,
Whether a little or a lot,
That I will treasure what I've got in you,
What I've got in you,
What I've got in you,

[Chorus]
So I'll dance the night away with you,
Take a step in forward and be true,
I will be your bride if you'll be my groom, I do,
I'll give you everything,
I don't need anything,
I don't need anything,
Anything but you,
Anything but you,
